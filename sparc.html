          <p class="p" id="skip">As an intern for SPARC, I conducted community engagement work in many different forms.</p>
          <p class="p">For targeted outreach to student organizations, I compiled detailed membership information. 
            I also advised academic librarians seeking to promote graduate and undergraduate student advocacy for Open Access and Open Educational Resources at their own institutions.</p>
          <p class = "p">Serving on the application review teams for OpenCon 2015-2018, I was one of the top three reviewers overall in my final year. 
            At that time, I evaluated more than 3000 applications from researchers and students in dozens of countries. 
            In 2017, I was recognized with others by name at the Max Planck Society in Berlin as one of the top overall reviewers for the OpenCon conference.</p> 
          <p class="p">On Capitol Hill in 2015, I engaged in legislative advocacy for the proposed Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR).</p>
          <p class="p">In 2014, I participated in a Congressional Advocacy Day for open scholarly communication. With my colleagues, 
            I received guidance from the Deputy Assistant for Legislative Affairs to the President of the United States.</p>
